/*
Today we are going to learn about SQL JOINs.
SQL JOINs are used to extract data from different tables
using one common column between them.

Example:
We can join a Students table and a Courses table
using a common column like student_id.
*/

/*
There are mainly four types of SQL JOINs:
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN.
*/

/*
INNER JOIN:
Returns only the rows that have matching values
in both tables.

/*
Now we are going to import the ClassicModels database in MySQL Workbench.

Steps:
1. Download classicmodels.sql as a ZIP from this link:
   https://gist.github.com/dronavallisaikrishna/aa569525a7dbce32cc2465beb2138a7d?utm_source=chatgpt.com
   → Save to Downloads and extract the SQL file
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect
3. (Optional) Create a clean database:
   CREATE DATABASE classicmodels;
   USE classicmodels;
4. File → Open SQL Script → Select classicmodels.sql → ⚡ Execute
5. Refresh Schemas → classicmodels with tables appears

That’s it 👍
